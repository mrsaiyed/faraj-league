/**
 * Returning a game to "not played" — admin only.
 *
 * Saving an empty stat sheet is not enough on its own: `admin-game-stats`
 * recomputes the score from whatever point totals remain, so an emptied game
 * lands on 0–0. Every "has this been played?" check in the site is
 * `score !== ''`, and '0' passes that, so the game still shows as complete and
 * still counts as a tie in the standings. Only NULL scores mark it unplayed.
 *
 * This runs entirely through Edge Functions that are already deployed, so
 * clearing a game needs no new backend. The last step, deleting the saved game
 * log, uses `admin-game-log` (migration 013) and is skipped quietly where that
 * is not deployed yet.
